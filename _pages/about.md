I am an [OSINT](https://www.sans.org/blog/what-is-open-source-intelligence/) specialist with a background in cybersecurity and software development.

I started getting into open-source intelligence in 2015 by playing CTFs and ARGs and making [information-gathering and processing tools](https://github.com/stars/soxoj/lists/my-osint-tools).

Since 2018 I've been talking about OSINT, search methods, and privacy at public events. I was a speaker at large international conferences: leHACK, Osintomatico, KazHackStan and ISS WORLD Europe / Middle East. Also, I prepared and conducted two training courses about open-source intelligence for cybersec students and private investigators. You can look at some of my talks in [this YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLskYWMG4mV-6osVePbwJa2Tp2Bc2EUI1p).

In 2020 I founded the OSINT mindset community ([first post](https://t.me/osint_mindset/5), [first meetup](https://t.me/osint_mindset/94)). The community has more than 20K subscribers, 4K members of [Investigation Forum](https://forum.osint-mindset.com), and dozens of active members and speakers in 3 countries and 5 cities. You can watch [records of meetup talks](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLskYWMG4mV-7A2tKggMryk18tbwC7jLhX) on YouTube, [listen to OSINT mindset podcasts](https://osint-mindset.mave.digital/) on various platforms, and [read the excellent wiki](https://osint-mindset.gitbook.io) on Gitbook.

Currently, I am a head of the OSINT Center of Excellence in [Social Links](https://sociallinks.io/). My department conduct investigations, teach OSINT and help to develop new methods and professional invesigation tools. I have experience in cybersecurity (antibot/anti-fraud protection, pentest), software development (mostly Python, also Go, Lua), building of development processes (Scrum, Kanban), and people management.

You can find my articles, guides, and just thoughts on [Substack](https://soxoj.substack.com/), [Medium (old)](https://soxoj.medium.com/), in [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Sox0j), the Telegram channels [Soxoj insides](https://t.me/soxoj_insides) and [OSINT mindset (old posts)](https://t.me/osint_mindset), and, of course, [in GitHub list of my guides and collections](https://github.com/stars/soxoj/lists/my-guides-and-collections).
